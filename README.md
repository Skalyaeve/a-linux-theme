Gtk-Theme-Raleigh is a re-creation of the original Raleigh theme, Red Hat's
(and later the GTK Project's) default theme for GTK+ 2.  Gtk-Theme-Raleigh
brings a unique early-2000's experience to a modern GTK+ 3-based desktop.
The primary focus of this theme is to authentically replicate the look-and-feel
of the Raleigh theme as it appeared between the years 2001-2004, or replicate
the appearance as authentically as possible.

There are other Raleigh theme look-alikes in existence, one of which was a
fallback theme for GTK+ 3 until GTK+ 3.24.  The main difference between
Gtk-Theme-Raleigh and other, similar themes is that this theme tries to mimic
the original Raleigh *to the letter*, appearing indistinguishable from
the original in as many places as possible.  By contrast, most themes designed
for GTK+ 3 or GTK 4 which are "look-alikes" of other classic GTK themes have
many artistic touches of the look-alike theme's own creator; as such, many
"look-alike" themes actually look very different from the themes they are
trying to emulate.
