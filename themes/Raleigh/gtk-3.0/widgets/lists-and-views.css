 * widgets are composed of a treeview inside a pop-up window; whenever the
 * user hovers the mouse over one of the completion entries, it implicitly
 * selects that entry in the treeview, but does not focus it.  This will color
 * the hovered item gray instead of blue, whereas GTK+ 2 Raleigh colored the
 * items blue anyway.  So add an override to color completion entries blue.
